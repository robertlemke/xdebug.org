<h2>Introduction <a name="introduction" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>Currently Xdebug only operates and handles system-local file names. It only
sees names as they are on the system that Xdebug/PHP runs on. Many IDEs and
debug adapters (IDEs) employ a "path mapping" feature, to map
Xdebug/PHP-local paths to the filesystem on which IDE users edit files. This
allows for IDEs to set breakpoints to the paths that Xdebug sees after
translating them from local paths.</p>

<p>To make this terminology more clear, from now on I will refer to
"remote paths" as the paths and file names that Xdebug sees on the
system that it runs on, and "local paths" as the paths and file
names in the environment where the IDE runs.</p>

<p>An example: Xdebug runs on a staging server, where an application is
located in the directory <code>/var/www/staging.example.com</code>. These same files are
equivalent to local paths on the system where the IDE can edit them in
<code>/home/user/projects/example.com</code>. The remote path here is
<code>/var/www/staging.example.com</code>, and the local path is
<code>/home/user/projects/example.com</code>.</p>

<p>Although path mapping features for debugging in IDEs are a sensible
solution, there are a few situations where this is not always enough:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some applications in PHP, most notably Neos/Flow, rewrite files during
execution into a cache, which then do not match the right files that a
developer would be editing. This is also a problem on local-only projects,
where the application runs on the same host as where the code is edited.</li>
<li>Setting up path mappings in an IDE can be challenging for developers of
WordPress plugins.</li>
<li>Templating systems often compile their template language down to PHP files
with a different name, but also the generating PHP code will not match the
line numbers with the lines in the template file.</li>
<li> Xdebug can <a href="https://xdebug.org/docs/all_settings#file_link_format">render links</a>
to paths whenever it displays a filename (in HTML) output, regardless of
whether debugging is even enabled. Because IDEs are not involved here, their
path mappings don't apply.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal <a name="proposal" href="#proposal">#</a></h2>
<p>In order to make Xdebug more adoptable and usable for these cases where
IDEs can't always help, a new feature is needed which would allow the
configuration of path, file, and line mappings solely through Xdebug.</p>

<p>Xdebug native path mappings can be configured through files.</p>

<p>Xdebug will scan for files ending in <code>.map</code> in the
<code>.xdebug</code> directory when a script starts, and the Xdebug mode (set through
the <a href="https://xdebug.org/docs/all_settings#mode">xdebug.mode</a> setting
or <code>XDEBUG_MODE</code> environment setting) is not <code>off</code>.</p>

<p>Xdebug will check for the <code>.xdebug</code> directory in the grand-parent
directory of the file that is being requested first, then in the parent
directory, and then in the directory of the file that is being requested. This
is mostly because it is common to have an entry file (often
<code>index.php</code>) in a <code>public_html</code> or <code>www</code>
directory, with other project files (including for example the vendor/
directory) in a parent directory. It allows for company/project wide path
names as well.</p>

<p>Mappings in files that are scanned later, override already existing
mappings.</p>

<p>More specific rules apply before more generic rules.</p>

<p>Xdebug native path mappings are used in the following situations:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>initiating a debugging connection through the <a
href="https://xdebug.org/docs/dbgp#connection-initialization">fileurl
element</a> of the debug initiation request.</li>
<li>setting a breakpoint</li>
<li>checking for breakpoints</li>
<li>rendering file names where <a
href="https://xdebug.org/docs/all_settings#file_link_format">xdebug.file_link_format</a>
applies</li>
</ol>

<p>An application can additionally configure path maps by calling
<code>xdebug_set_source_map()</code> with a file name as argument. Rules in
the parsed file(s) override earlier path mappings of the same type.</p>

<p>The file scanning based approach is necessary so that the <a
href="https://xdebug.org/docs/dbgp#connection-initialization">fileurl
element</a> in the debug initiation request can be mapped, as when an
application gets to call xdebug_set_source_map() during script execution, it
is already too late to apply that mapping to the debug initiation.</p>

<h2>File Format <a name="file-format" href="#file-format">#</a></h2>
<p>Each mapping file must end in <code>.map</code>, and the following stanzas
and syntax is supported:</p>

<dl>
<dt>remote_prefix: &lt;path&gt; (optional)</dt>
<dd>Defines the prefix that is prepended to every remote path. Can be present
more than once, and applies from the moment it is parsed only.</dd>

<dt>local_prefix: &lt;path&gt; (optional)</dt>
<dd>Defines the prefix that is prepended to every local path. Can be present
more than once, and applies from the moment it is parsed only.</dd>

<dt>&lt;remote_path&gt; = &lt;local_path&gt;</dt>
<dd>Creates a mapping from remote_path to local_path. Both of these paths are either:
<ul>
<li>
	a directory name (<code>cache/</code>) &mdash; <b>must</b> end in a <code>/</code>.
</li>
<li>
	a file name (<code>cache/MyRewrittenClass.php</code>)
</li>
<li>
	a file name + line number (range) (<code>templates/layout.ezt:4-20</code> or
	<code>templates/layout.ezt:24</code>). A single number means the start
	and end "range" is the same.
</li>
</ul>
<p>A <b>remote path</b> is the directory/file name as seen by Xdebug on the system
where it runs, and a <b>local</b> path is the directory/file name that an IDE
user would edit directly.</p>
</dd>

<p>Lines starting with # are comments.</p>

<p>Empty lines are allowed, and are ignored.</p>

<h2>Example Files <a name="example-files" href="#example-files">#</a></h2>

<h3>Full Directories</h3>
<p>This is an equivalent to what IDE's currently provide.</p>

<pre>
/var/www/ = /home/derick/projects/example.com/
</pre>

<p>This one line file maps all files under the <code>/var/www/</code>
directory to the equivalent file name in the
<code>/home/derick/projects/example.com/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Alternatives to this mapping file, with the same exact meaning:</p>

<pre>
local_prefix: /home/derick/projects

/var/www/ = example.com/
</pre>

<p>The local_prefix gets prepended to <code>example.com/</code>, making it
<code>/home/derick/projects/example.com/</code> again.</p>

<h3>File to File Maps</h3>
<p>These are primarily for the Neos/Flow use case, that require mapping of
file names to other file names.</p>

<pre>
# Path prefixes
remote_prefix: /home/derick/dev/neos/Data/Temporary/Development/Cache/Code/Flow_Object_Classes
local_prefix: /home/derick/dev/neos/Packages

# The mapping table
Neos_Behat_Command_BehatCommandController.php = Application/Neos.Behat/Classes/Command/BehatCommandController.php
Neos_CliSetup_Command_SetupCommandController.php = Application/Neos.CliSetup/Classes/Command/SetupCommandController.php
Neos_CliSetup_Command_WelcomeCommandController.php = Application/Neos.CliSetup/Classes/Command/WelcomeCommandController.php
</pre>

<p>You can see why it makes sense to have the <code>remote_prefix</code> and
<code>local_prefix</code> stanzas, as they drastically reduce the contents of
the files, also making them more legible.</p>

<h3>Line Range Maps</h3>
<p>For use with for example templating systems.</p>

<pre>
# Path prefixes
remote_prefix: /home/derick/dev/xdebug.cloud/src/cache/compiled_templates/xhtml-updqr0
local_prefix: /home/derick/dev/xdebug.cloud/src/templates

# The mapping table
user-info-823edfe12e38a649355c5172b9d98e0a.php:2-31 = user-info.ezt:1
user-info-823edfe12e38a649355c5172b9d98e0a.php:32-33 = user-info.ezt:2
user-info-823edfe12e38a649355c5172b9d98e0a.php:34-36 = user-info.ezt:3
user-info-823edfe12e38a649355c5172b9d98e0a.php:37 = user-info.ezt:4
user-info-823edfe12e38a649355c5172b9d98e0a.php:38 = user-info.ezt:5
user-info-823edfe12e38a649355c5172b9d98e0a.php:39-40 = user-info.ezt:6
user-info-823edfe12e38a649355c5172b9d98e0a.php:41-46 = user-info.ezt:7
â€¦
user-info-823edfe12e38a649355c5172b9d98e0a.php:301-302 = user-info.ezt:73
user-info-823edfe12e38a649355c5172b9d98e0a.php:303 = user-info.ezt:74-75
user-info-823edfe12e38a649355c5172b9d98e0a.php:304-306 = user-info.ezt:76
</pre>

<p>As you can see, these files will get pretty big fast.</p>
